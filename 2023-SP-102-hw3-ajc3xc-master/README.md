# Submission Instructions

Students should submit their written assignments as a pdf document with the title "hw3-sol.pdf" (either a scanned copy of hand-written version, or created using the provided LaTeX template), with the name written on the top left corner of the first page.  Also, each programming assignment should be submitted as an independent Jupyter notebook, labeled as "<student_last_name>-cs2500-hw3-<problem_number>.ipynb". Please follow the Insertion Sort template provided in the class to package your code.

# Instructions for Cloning hw3 folder

Students will be given access to the Git repository as 'developers'. As a result, they can clone the master branch and submit their respective assignments by following the procedure given below:

## Execute once, to clone a repository:
```
$ git clone https://git-classes.mst.edu/2023-SP-CS2500/<repository_name>.git
```

## Execute as many times as you like from within the directory/repository you cloned to your hard drive (just an example):
```
# To check the status of your repository:
$ git status

# To stage/add a file:
$ git add *.py *.pdf *.md

# To add a folder:
$ git add SUBDIRECTORY/*

# To commit changes and document them:
$ git commit -m "Informative description of the commit"

# To submit your assignments:
$ git push
```


## Do not add:
Compiled or generated files like *.out, *.log, *.syntex.gz, *.bib, your executable files, etc. Put the name of these files in a text file named .gitignore

If you see your changes reflected on the git-classes site, you have submitted successfully.
